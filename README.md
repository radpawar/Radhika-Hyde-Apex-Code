## How Do You Plan to Deploy Your Change
Step 1: Open your VS Code and open a new terminal.

Step 2: Enter git clone https://github.com/radpawar/Radhika-Hyde-Apex-Code.git to clone the repo.

Step 3: Check if the new directory is created in your local system and open this directory from VS Code using step 4 below.

Step 4: Go to VS Code, and select the 'Open Folder' option. Select the new directory folder so that it will open in VS Code.

Step 5: Open the command palette using Ctrl+Shift+P and create a default scratch org. 

Step 6: Once the default scratch org is created, now push your source component into it using the command palette Ctrl+Shift+P -> SFDX: Push Source to Default Scratch Org.

Step 7: Once the component is deployed into your org, it will give the notification/message that Push Source to Default scratch org successfully ran.

Also, you can check in your org via setup-> Deployment status and see the success/failure result.
